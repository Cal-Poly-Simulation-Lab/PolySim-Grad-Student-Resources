# Mehiel's Guidelines for Completing a Thesis Project

Please take a look at the following guidelines for completing the four major tasks/milestones required for your thesis.  Each of these milestonse are setup to help you make continuous project to the completion of the thesis project.  Remember, the work you do to complete the thesis project is in addition to completing these milestones.  These milestones are meant to keep you on task, to get buy-in from your thesis committee, and provide you the opportunity to share your work with others in the department.  Remember, even though most of your time will be spent working on the thesis project (building hardware, writing code, doing math/analysis) the written thesis is the primary document you will defend.  Defending your written work is what earns you the MS degree.

These guidelines have been developed with the intent of finishing a thesis in one academic year.

## Task Zero:  Brainstorm a Thesis Project Idea for Blended Students

If you are taking on the Blended MS program, or BMS, you will be accepted into the program toward the end of your last term at Cal Poly.  At that time, it makes sense to start work on brainstorming and working out more details for your project.  We will start having informal meetings to discuss your ideas and how they relate to the overall goals of the PolySim lab.  There are no deliverables at this time, but starting the project definition phase early will help you get a running start in the fall term when you need to complete your literature review, form your thesis committee, and present your thesis proposal.

## Task One:  The Literature Review and Thesis Proposal

This section coveres your first milestone/deliverable for your thesis project, the literature review and the thesis proposal.  Your grade for Aero 599 thesis units for the fall term will be assigned based on completing these tasks.

### The Literature Review

* Weeks 1-3 - Topic development with advisor
* Week 4/5 - Develop literature review outline
* Week 6 - Form your committee
* Week 7 - Send literature review to your *advisor*
* Week 8 - Send literature review to your *committee*
* Week 9/10 - Thesis Proposal

### The Literature Review

The elements of an engineering literature review include a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The introduction defines the topic and its significance, while the body analyzes and synthesizes the existing research by comparing, contrasting, and critiquing different sources. The conclusion summarizes key findings, identifies gaps in knowledge, and explains how the reviewed work leads to the author's own project or research.

#### Introduction

* Background and purpose: Provide an overview of the topic, define any key terminology, and state the purpose and scope of the review.
* Significance: Explain why the topic is important and what gap in existing knowledge your review will address.
* Organization: Briefly outline the structure of the review. 

#### Body

* Evaluation and synthesis: Critically analyze the literature, evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of different studies.
* Comparison and contrast: Discuss how different studies are similar and how they vary in their methods, results, and conclusions.
* Categorization: Organize the literature into categories, such as by theme, methodology, or the position taken by the authors.
* Historical context: Provide historical context or an overview of how the research area has developed over time. 

#### Conclusion

* Summary of findings: Briefly summarize the most significant findings and key points from the reviewed literature.
* Identification of gaps: Highlight the remaining gaps in knowledge and unanswered questions in the research.
* Implications: Explain the implications of the reviewed work for future research and how your own project builds upon those works.

#### Reminders

* Be sure to review literature or projects internal to Cal Poly, but be sure to look *outside* Cal Poly to see what otehr folks are doing.
* 

### The Thesis Proposal

The goal of a thesis proposal is threefold:

* Introduce the project to the committee and to get you and the committee on the same page.
* Formulate and articulate your thesis project statement and project timeline
* Define what project success looks like and get agreement from your committee

Achieving these goals will give you a clear scope of work and path for successful completion of your thesis project.

#### Typical Proposal Sections Include:

* Introduction/Background to the topic
Give a few slides to introduce yourself, the committee, and the topic of your thesis at a high level.  Then give a few slides that summarize your literature review.
* Thesis Statement
With the Intro/Background in mind, give a concise thesis statement.  Answer the question, what do you want to accomplish with your thesis project?
* Proposed Scope of Work
In a few slides, what tasks and work do you need to complete to finish your thesis project in a timely manner?
* Work to Date
Of the work outlined above, what have you done to date?  How does this work indicate you are on the right track?
* Proposed Schedule and Risks
Give a weekly proposed schedule to complete your thesis project.  Be sure to include important milestones.  You should include any _buffer_ time and *time required to write the thesis* - you should write as you go, but give yourself a few weeks to finish up the document.  Also, don't forget you need to give your committee *four* weeks to review the document before you defend.  On the note, if you can do it, try not to defend during finals week.
* Desired Outcomes (what does success look like?  How will the committee know you are done?)
This is a major outcome/goal of the thesis proposal.  If you can articulate what success looks like for your project and the committee agrees, it is easy to know when you are done.
* Questions?
* References
List relevant references (mostly from your literature review).

You don't have to include all the topics as slide titles; you can be creative and/or customize your slide titles to fit you proposal.  Here are a few examples from prior successful proposals:

## Task Two: The Thesis Seminar

* Seminar - any week

## Task Three: The Thesis Write-up

### Thesis Outline Fundamentals

A basic outline of a good thesis contains three parts.  The first part is the combination of your introduction and literature review.  The second part contains the approach, methodology, results, and analysis, of your project.  Finally, end with a third section with a conclusion and discussion of future work.  All three parts typically result in 5-6 chapters depending on how you decide to organize your content.

### Introduction/Lit review

The introduction should start with a "soft" introduction and background to your thesis project.  You want to pull the reader in and ground the project in the broader context.  But, don't get cute.  The reader will have some technical background; keep this in mind.  The important part of the intro/lit review section, is that the reader should have an understanding of YOUR thesis project within a few pages of the introduction.  This does not mean you should state your thesis in all it's technical glory, but instead, make sure your reader is motivated to read the rest of the thesis because they know where everything is going.  An introduction can be anywhere from 5-10 pages.

The literature review comes next.  In this chapter, you want to draw your reader into the more technical nature of the project.  One of the primary goals of the lit review is to provide technical context of work that is related to you project.  The lit review should support the need for your project and answer the questions, "why is my project necessary, and what gap in the relevant work does my project fill?"  Toward the end of your lit review, you can now restate your thesis statement (or thesis project description) in a more detailed and technical manner.  This statement should build on your prior statement from the introduction chapter.

The rest of your lit review chapter should then focus on descripting the rest of your thesis.  Provide the reader with a description or map of the rest of the document.  What will the reader be reading? The lit review chapter can be anywhere from 10-20 pages.

### Middle Section

The middle section of your thesis is should be a standard approach, methodology, results, and analysis set of chapters.  Your chapters don't have to fall directly into this template and I encourage you to name you chapters with more relevant titles, but the basic idea is to tell the reader, what you are going to do, how your are going to do it, what results you found, and what the results mean in the context of you project.  This section will vary significantly by project and can be anywhere from 30-50 pages.  Also, this section will most likely contain many equations and figures.  Finally, when it comes to derivations, focus on your own work.  In other words, there is no reason to provide a detailed derivation of something that is contained in textbook or some other reference.  But, if you derived some new (or slightly different) set of equations or results, you should present them in these sections.

### Wrap it all up

Finally, to finalize the thesis, you want to provide the reader with a standard conclusion.  A conclusion should summarize the project, methodology, results, and analysis.  Think of it as, "I said I was going to do this, that is what I did, thank you."  In addition, you want to include a section on future work.  You are writing this section for the next person that comes along to advance the work you did as part of your thesis project.  Discuss issues you came across that deserve further attention.  Where there new problems you discovered that someone else could take on as a new thesis project?  The conclusion and future work chapter is typically 5-10 pages.

### Other stuff

Don't forget to include any appendices (detailed derivations, tables, etc.) and a list of your references.  Also, you want to open your thesis with a solid, SELF CONTAINED, abstract.  The abstract should not reference the thesis or any other document.  It should provide the reader with an overview of the project, and the significant findings or results.
